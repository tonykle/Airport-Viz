# General Information
This is a simple airport information visualizer application. It uses the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) API (http://services.faa.gov/) to display some information relating to a number of the major US airports. For this project, I used React.js, along with Node.js/Express in order to display my familiarity with modern technologies. I used webpack to bundle this project. Though it was a little bit overkill using webpack for a project this small, I wanted to use this opportunity to further my experience with it.

## Technologies
- React.js
- Node.js / Express
- Sass
- webpack
